Software engineer specialized in Javascript (React, Vue, NodeJS). I also have experience with cloud development (Google Cloud and AWS), Typescript, React Native, NestJS, Next, Nx, Python, Express, Wordpress, Shopify and UI/UX design. I am very curious about generative AI and I'm currently building experiments with it.
