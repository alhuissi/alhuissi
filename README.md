Software engineer specialized in Javascript frameworks and libraries (Vue, React, and NodeJS) . I also have experience with cloud development (Google Cloud and AWS), Typescript, React Native, NestJS, Next, NX, Python, Express, Wordpress, Shopify and UI/UX design. I am very curious about machine learning and blockhain development, topics that I'm currently studying on my own.
