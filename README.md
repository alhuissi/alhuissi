Web Developer specialized in Javascript frameworks (Vue, React and Angular) and Node. I also have experience with cloud development (Google Cloud and AWS), Python, Django, Express, MongoDB, PHP, UI/UX design, Wordpress, Shopify and Photoshop and videogame development. I am very curious about Machine Learning, Web XR and Cybersecurity, topics that I'm currently studying on my own.
